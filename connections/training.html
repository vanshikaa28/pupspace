            <h1>How to Completely Train Your Dog</h1>
            <p>
                Are you ready to start training your dog or puppy? Proper training and socialization
                 are among your dog's basic needs. It's important to start training your dog as soon as possible to sit, stay, come, go to their crate, 
                 and to go potty outside. And believe it or not, it's something you can do yourself as a beginner.<br><br>

                At first, dog training can seem pretty overwhelming, especially if this is your first dog. The truth is that training your dog is a very 
                big project.<img  class="pic" src="static/blog/train.png"> If you take it step by step, you will find the task to be far less daunting. Here is some information to help get you started:<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Start a Dog Obedience Program:</b> Learn how to set a basic foundation before you begin to train your dog.<br><br></li>
                    <li><b>Train Your Dog Using Games:</b> Training your dog should be fun! Everyone knows it's easier to learn when you are having a good time,
                        so try implementing some games into your dog training regimen.<br><br></li>
                    <li><b>Six Weeks to a Well-Trained Dog: </b>Using this schedule as a guide, you can teach your dog the basics in about six weeks.<br><br></li>
                    <li><b>Positive Reinforcement:</b> There are many different ways to train a dog, but most dog professionals agree that the positive way is the best for
                        both the dog and trainer.<br><br></li>

            <h2>House Training and Crate Training</h2>
            <p>
                <img class="pic2" src="static/blog/train2.jpg">
                Unless you plan to keep your dog outdoors—and few of us do because it's not recommended—you'll 
                need to teach your dog where to eliminate. Therefore, house training (also called housebreaking or potty training) is one of the first things you need to work on with your dog. 
                Crate training can be a very helpful part of the training process. <br>
                This includes house training as well as many other areas of training:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Crate Training Dogs and Puppies:</b> Here are the basics of training your dog or puppy to accept and even enjoy the crate. Not only will it help with housebreaking, 
                        but it will also give your dog a place of his own.<br></li><br>
                    <li><b>How to House Train your Dog:</b> When it comes down to it, house training is not that complicated, but this doesn't mean it's easy. Consistency and diligence are key 
                        during the housebreaking process.<br></li>
                    <li><b>Submissive/Excitement Urination in Dogs:</b>If your dog is still having accidents in the house, it may be more than a simple housebreaking issue. Your dog might urinate 
                        out of excitement or to express submissive behavior.<br></li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Leash Training Dogs and Puppies</h2>
            <p>Every dog needs to learn to walk on a leash. Besides the fact that most areas have leash laws, there will be times when keeping your dog on a leash is for his own safety. Learn how 
                to introduce your dog or puppy to the leash, then teach him how to walk properly on the leash, even beside you on a bike. A loose leash walk teaches your dog not to pull or lunge 
                when on ​the leash, making the experience more enjoyable for both you and your dog.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>How To Socialize Dogs and Puppies</h2>
            <p>Socialization means training your puppy or adult dog to accept new people, animals, and various places by exposing him to these things.<img  class="pic" src="static/blog/train3.jpg">
            Socialized dogs are less likely to develop behavior problems and are generally more welcomed by others. 
            Socialization can also help prevent the development of fears and phobias.

             <br>The bottom line is that socializing your dog or puppy will make him a happier, more well-behaved dog.</p>

            <h2>Clicker Training for Dogs</h2>
            <p>Clicker training, a common form of positive reinforcement, is a simple and effective dog training method. Although it is still fine to train your dog without clicker training, many
                 people find it helpful. With clicker training, you can easily and effectively teach your dog all kinds of basic and advanced commands and tricks. It's fast and easy to learn how 
                 to clicker train your dog</p>
