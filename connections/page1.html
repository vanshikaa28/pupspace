        <p><center>Homemade puppy food can save you a little bit of money and allow you 
            to custom-design a diet that fits your puppy's needs. All growing puppies need proper nutrition.
            However, choosing the right diet for your puppy can be an overwhelming task.
            <br>
            When you choose to feed your puppy home-prepared food, it takes a certain amount of commitment on your part. 
            Make sure you have the time to prepare the food properly and on a regular basis. There's a lot you need to 
            know before you can start feeding your dog an appropriate homemade diet.</p></center>

      <h2>How to Prepare Homemade Puppy Food</h2> 
      <p>
        In general, puppies need about twice as many calories per day than their adult counterparts. According to the Committee 
        on Nutrient Requirements of Cats and Dogs of the National Academy of Science, a 10-pound puppy that is expected to weigh 
        33 pounds at adulthood needs to eat about 990 calories per day.2 In addition, puppies need more protein, fat, vitamins 
        and minerals than adult dogs.<img class= "food1" src="static/blog/food1.jpg">
    <br>
        A homemade puppy diet should contain the proper balance of:
    <ul>
        <li>Protein, such as chicken, turkey, fish, lean beef</li>
        <li>Carbohydrates, like rice, pasta, potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetables, such as peas, green beans, carrots</li>
        <li>Fat, often in the form of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Vitamin/mineral supplements (purchased from a reputable company)</li>
    </ul><br>
     
    Once you have chosen a recipe, it's time to prepare it for your dog. Many owners
    who feed home-prepared diets set up a regular schedule, setting aside time weekly
    or monthly to prepare and portion the diet. The food can be prepared in bulk and portioned into containers 
    (one container per meal makes it extra-easy). You can keep meals frozen for several months or refrigerated for 
    about 5 days. When the supply of pre-prepared meals runs low, it's time to make a new batch. If you like to feed a variety of foods, you can make multiple batches and color code by ingredients, rotating out the different meals.
    <br>
    Remember to increase portions appropriately as your puppy grows. 
    It's best to weigh your puppy every week or two to make sure you are feeding the proper amount of calories.
